# Mastering Time Zones in BigQuery: Converting to UTC

When working with time-sensitive data across different geographical locations, handling time zones correctly is crucial. Google BigQuery provides powerful functions to manage time zones, making it easier to standardize your data to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). In this post, we'll explore how to use BigQuery's timezone functions to convert input timestamps to UTC.

## The Importance of UTC

UTC is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. Using UTC as a standard in your data pipeline ensures consistency and avoids ambiguities caused by daylight saving time and different time zones.

## BigQuery Timezone Functions

BigQuery offers several functions to work with time zones. We'll focus on two main functions:

1. `TIMESTAMP`: Creates a timestamp value from a string.
2. `TIMESTAMP_CONVERT_TZ`: Converts a timestamp from one time zone to another.

## Converting Local Time to UTC

Let's say we have timestamps from different time zones, and we want to convert them all to UTC. Here's how we can do it:

```sql
SELECT
  input_timestamp,
  input_timezone,
  TIMESTAMP_CONVERT_TZ(
    TIMESTAMP(input_timestamp, input_timezone),
    input_timezone,
    'UTC'
  ) AS utc_timestamp
FROM
  your_table;
```

Let's break down this query:

1. `TIMESTAMP(input_timestamp, input_timezone)`: This creates a timestamp from the input string, interpreting it in the specified input time zone.
2. `TIMESTAMP_CONVERT_TZ(...)`: This function converts the timestamp from the input time zone to UTC.

## Practical Example

Imagine we have a table `global_events` with events from different time zones:

```sql
CREATE TABLE global_events (
  event_name STRING,
  local_timestamp STRING,
  timezone STRING
);

INSERT INTO global_events
VALUES
  ('New York Event', '2024-09-08 14:30:00', 'America/New_York'),
  ('London Meeting', '2024-09-08 19:30:00', 'Europe/London'),
  ('Tokyo Conference', '2024-09-09 10:30:00', 'Asia/Tokyo');
```

Now, let's convert all these local times to UTC:

```sql
SELECT
  event_name,
  local_timestamp,
  timezone,
  TIMESTAMP_CONVERT_TZ(
    TIMESTAMP(local_timestamp, timezone),
    timezone,
    'UTC'
  ) AS utc_timestamp
FROM
  global_events;
```

This query will produce the following result:

```
+------------------+---------------------+------------------+---------------------+
| event_name       | local_timestamp     | timezone         | utc_timestamp       |
+------------------+---------------------+------------------+---------------------+
| New York Event   | 2024-09-08 14:30:00 | America/New_York | 2024-09-08 18:30:00 |
| London Meeting   | 2024-09-08 19:30:00 | Europe/London    | 2024-09-08 18:30:00 |
| Tokyo Conference | 2024-09-09 10:30:00 | Asia/Tokyo       | 2024-09-09 01:30:00 |
+------------------+---------------------+------------------+---------------------+
```

As you can see, all local times have been converted to their corresponding UTC time.

## Best Practices

1. Always store timestamps in UTC in your database.
2. Convert to local time zones only when presenting data to users.
3. Be aware of daylight saving time changes when working with historical data.
4. Use the IANA time zone database names (like 'America/New_York') instead of abbreviations (like 'EST') for more accurate results.

## Conclusion

Handling time zones correctly is essential for maintaining data integrity in global applications. BigQuery's timezone functions make it easy to standardize your timestamps to UTC, ensuring consistency across your data pipelines and analyses.

By converting all timestamps to UTC at the point of data ingestion or processing, you can simplify your data models and avoid the complexities of dealing with multiple time zones in your queries and applications.

Remember, when it comes to time data, UTC is your friend!
