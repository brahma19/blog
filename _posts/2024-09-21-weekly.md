# Finding Nearest location based on lat/long fields in BigQuery

Inner and outer joins are common use cases in SQL but one in a while we get a use case where we need to use cross join, once such use case is to finding the nearest location from a give lat/long position.

## The Problem
We have store locaiton data and need to find correct weather condition to predict the logistics delays for supply chain analytics. 
What we have is the source location (lat and long) but we do not have reliable weather readings.
To solve this problem we are going to use the NOAA weather data that is published by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) government department, it contains historical information as well .
Now the problem is these 2 tables does not have any keys to join the data, only possible link is to use the location fields and find out which weather station is the nearest to this store and then enrich the data for feature engineeing pipeline.
To summerize
We have two tables:
1. A source table with locations stored as string (latitude and longitude)
2. Reference Table with target location (also with latitude and longitude) , lets call this a "weather station" table.

Our goal is to find the nearest weather station for each location in the source table.

## Approach 1: Cross Join and Distance Calculation

The simplest approach is to perform a cross join between our source locations and weather stations, calculate the distance for each pair, and then select the nearest station for each source location.

Here's the query:

```sql
WITH source_data AS (
  SELECT 
    id,
    CAST(latitude AS FLOAT64) AS source_lat,
    CAST(longitude AS FLOAT64) AS source_lon
  FROM `projectid.datasetname.source_table`
),

weather_stations AS (
  SELECT 
    station_id,
    CAST(latitude AS FLOAT64) AS station_lat,
    CAST(longitude AS FLOAT64) AS station_lon
  FROM `projectid.datasetname.weather_stations_table`
),

distance_calc AS (
  SELECT 
    s.id AS source_id,
    w.station_id,
    ST_DISTANCE(ST_GEOGPOINT(s.source_lon, s.source_lat), ST_GEOGPOINT(w.station_lon, w.station_lat)) AS distance
  FROM source_data sd
  CROSS JOIN weather_stations ws
),

ranked_stations AS (
  SELECT 
    source_id,
    station_id,
    distance,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY source_id ORDER BY distance) AS rank
  FROM distance_calc
)

SELECT 
  source_id,
  station_id AS nearest_station_id,
  distance AS distance_to_nearest_station
FROM ranked_stations
WHERE rank = 1
```

This approach works well for small to medium-sized datasetnames. However, as the number of source locations or weather stations grows, the cross join can become computationally expensive.

## Approach 2: Optimized Query with Bounding Box

To optimize our query, we can use BigQuery's geospatial functions to create a bounding box around each source point and only consider weather stations within that box. This significantly reduces the number of distance calculations needed.

Here's the optimized query:

```sql
WITH source_data AS (
  SELECT 
    id,
    ST_GEOGPOINT(CAST(longitude AS FLOAT64), CAST(latitude AS FLOAT64)) AS source_point
  FROM `projectid.datasetname.source_table`
),

weather_stations AS (
  SELECT 
    station_id,
    ST_GEOGPOINT(CAST(longitude AS FLOAT64), CAST(latitude AS FLOAT64)) AS station_point
  FROM `projectid.datasetname.weather_stations_table`
),

nearest_station AS (
  SELECT 
    s.id AS source_id,
    ARRAY_AGG(
      STRUCT(w.station_id, 
             ST_DISTANCE(s.source_point, w.station_point) AS distance)
      ORDER BY ST_DISTANCE(s.source_point, w.station_point)
    )[OFFSET(0)] AS nearest
  FROM source_data sd
  JOIN weather_stations ws
  ON ST_DWithin(s.source_point, w.station_point, 100000)  -- 100km radius
  GROUP BY s.id
)

SELECT 
  source_id,
  nearest.station_id AS nearest_station_id,
  nearest.distance AS distance_to_nearest_station
FROM nearest_station
```

## Key Optimizations

1. **Geospatial Functions**: We use `ST_GEOGPOINT` to create geography points directly, which simplifies our distance calculations.

2. **Bounding Box**: The `ST_DWithin` function creates a bounding box around each source point, considering only weather stations within 100km. This drastically reduces the number of distance calculations.

3. **Efficient Aggregation**: We use `ARRAY_AGG` with `ORDER BY` and fetching the 1st record to efficiently select the nearest station for each source point in a single pass.

## Performance Comparison

The optimized query will generally perform much better, especially for larger datasetnames. Here's why:

- **Reduced Computations**: Instead of calculating distances between every source point and every weather station, we only calculate distances for stations within the bounding box.
- **Less Data Movement**: By filtering stations early in the query, we reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed in subsequent steps.

## Conclusion

When working with geospatial data in BigQuery, it's crucial to leverage the platform's specialized functions. While a cross join approach is intuitive and works for smaller datasetnames, using functions like `ST_DWithin` and `ST_DISTANCE` can significantly improve performance for larger datasetnames.

Remember to adjust the radius in the `ST_DWithin` function based on your specific use case and data distribution. A larger radius ensures you don't miss any potential nearest stations but may increase computation time.

By optimizing your geospatial queries, you can achieve faster results and more efficient use of your BigQuery resources.
